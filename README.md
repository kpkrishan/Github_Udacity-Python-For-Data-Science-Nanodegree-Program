### Project Title
# Github:Udacity-Python-For_Data-Science-Nanodegree-Program

### Description
This Project is all about the learning of version control using the Bikeshare Project.
In the previous project we did ananlysis of three files of bikeshare data.
And using those files and output file we will be working on version control i.e Github
This project is basically the documentation of commands used while uploading the file 
on github repository.

### Project Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### About Datasets
In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 
You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### What Software Do I Need?

To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).


### Files used
To answer the questions using Python,  will need to write a Python script  
with the help of csv files and names of file are given below:

1.chicago.csv
2.new_york_city.csv
3.washington.csv
4. bikeshare.py
5. .gitignore

### Credits
To complete this project i used various blogs and github repos and questions asked on
stackoverflow were very helpful.
